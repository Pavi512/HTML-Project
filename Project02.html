      <dd>
        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
        documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
        content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
        technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
        languages such as JavaScript.

      <dd>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a
        markup language, such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as
        SVG, MathML, or XHTML).CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide
        Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

      <dt>JAVA</dt>
      <dd>
        Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented
        programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run
        anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
        platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java
        applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java
        virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer
        architecture.
