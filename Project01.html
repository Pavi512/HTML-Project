    <h3>3.Aswathama (2020)</h3>
    <p>Box Office collection : <mark>₹15.30 crore worldwide</mark></p>
    <p>
      Released on January 31, 2020, Aswathama is an action-thriller starring
      Naga Shaurya, who also wrote the story. Directed by Ramana Teja, the movie
      follows Gana, who returns to India for his sister's wedding only to
      discover she has been drugged and raped by a psychopathic serial offender.
      The film focuses on Gana’s intense quest to track down the perpetrator,
      who is a doctor, and protect other potential victims. It was noted for its
      raw action sequences and a strong antagonist performance by Jisshu
      Sengupta, though the plot was considered predictable by some critics.
